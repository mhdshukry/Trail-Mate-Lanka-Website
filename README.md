Train tickets reservations system

The Online Seat Reservation System is an automated system that allows customers to purchase tickets and reserve seats for events such as concerts, plays, sports events, and other shows. This system typically includes a website, which allows customers to search for available seats and make their purchases. Many systems also provide additional features such as seat maps and seating charts.
